// Shatter Stone: Stylized Gemstones // 2022 //

- Package setup for built-in render pipeline by default. 

- If using URP make sure to open the URP package in the shader folder, this will replace the shader with a URP version along with materials. 

- Gemstone shatter and spawn controlled by script graphs.  

- If scripts are not showing on the prefabs then check Unity's Visual Scripting package is installed. 

- In demo level simply play scene and click on a log to trigger the gem spawn and eventual shatter. 

- Dirt levels controlled by vertex colors. If making new clusters you will have to bake or paint on the dirt. 

Shaders made with Amplify Shader Editor.
